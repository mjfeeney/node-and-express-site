    p In this project, I created a portfolio site to showcase the projects I've built thus far in my JavaScript TechDegree. The site will contain a modern landing page, an about page where you'll have a chance to share contact info, and a series of project pages to show off and detail at least the first few projects from this Techdegree.

      //- Use the Pug `each` iterator to loop over the projects in your data file  
      
        //- Use the example Pug code below and interpolated template literals as needed to dynamically generate:
          //- The paths in the link's href and img's src attributes
          //- The text 'Thumbnail' interpolated with the project title for the img's alt attribute
          //- The project title for the h5 element's text
